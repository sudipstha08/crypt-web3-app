# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

- Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
  npx hardhat accounts
  npx hardhat compile
  npx hardhat clean
  npx hardhat test
  npx hardhat node
  node scripts/sample-script.js
  npx hardhat help
  npx hardhat
```

- Inorder to have our contract deployed we need to have some ethereum in our account already for gas fees

## Alchemy
- Alchemy Supernode is the most widely used blockchain API for Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Flow and Crypto.org

## Hardhat Waffle
- Waffle is a library for writing and testing smart contracts. Sweeter, simpler and faster than Truffle. Works with ethers-js.
